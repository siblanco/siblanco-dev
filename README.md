# siblanco.dev rewrite

Rewriting my personal website using [Astro](https://astro.build/).

It was written in [Nuxt 2](https://nuxtjs.org/) before.
For the content I was using Wordpress with the [WP REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/).

The plan was to move to Markdown files and to try out Astro.
It was a pleasure to work with Astro and I'm happy with the result.

Here is a little script to migrate the content from Wordpress to Markdown files: [siblanco-dev-wp-to-md](https://github.com/siblanco/siblanco-dev-wp-to-md)

You can view the result on [siblanco.dev](https://siblanco.dev/).
